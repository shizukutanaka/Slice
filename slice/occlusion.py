"""Occlusion reasoning — WHY a joint isn't observed.

"Missing" isn't one thing: a joint hidden inside the silhouette
(occluded) is a different claim than one cropped by the frame
(truncated) or simply not rendered (absent). The mask bounds tell
which: inside the foreground region → occluded; past the frame →
truncated; neither → absent. Predicted joints carry a location, so
each also gets checked against the mask.
