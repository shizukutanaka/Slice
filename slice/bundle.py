"""Dataset bundling — a KnowledgeStore as one portable archive.

`dataset` flattens docs into tables; `bundle` packages them for
transport: a single `.zip` containing every schema-valid document
plus a `manifest.json` recording ids, models and counts, so a
receiver knows what's inside without unzipping everything.

Only valid documents ship — the same `validate` gate the store
enforces on save is re-applied on export, and skipped files are
counted in the manifest rather than silently dropped.
