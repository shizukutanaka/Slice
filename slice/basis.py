"""Basis vocabulary — canonical registry of joint provenance strings.

Every Joint carries a `basis` string saying *what evidence produced it*.
Until now each module invented its own phrasing; this module is the
shared vocabulary (AUDIT P4-22). It does NOT rename existing strings —
stored Knowledge documents must stay readable — it classifies them into
evidence categories and defines the prefixes new code should use.

Categories (weakest → strongest evidence):
    "observation"    measured directly from pixels
    "mirror"         copied across the body axis from an observed peer
    "interpolation"  placed between two observed anchors
    "prior"          placed by anatomical statistics alone
    "transform"      produced by a spatial/pose transform (retarget etc.)
    "unknown"        unrecognised wording — flagged, not rejected

New basis strings should start with one of the PREFIXES below so
`category()` can classify them mechanically.
