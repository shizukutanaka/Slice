"""Bone-level silhouette coverage — do bones stay inside the body?

`evid` audits whether each *joint* sits on the mask. This audits the
*segments between them*: a bone is a physical body part, so the line
shoulder→elbow should pass through foreground pixels. A bone that
crosses background is anatomically impossible — either the joint
positions are wrong or the body isn't what the mask says.

`check(skel, mask)` walks each bone at ~2px steps and reports:

- per-bone {covered_fraction, gaps: [{start_t, end_t, length_px}]}
  where a gap is a contiguous run of background crossings
- `broken` — observed bones whose largest gap exceeds GAP_PX and
  whose endpoints are both observed (a predicted bone crossing
  background is normal: prediction interpolates through empty space)
- `verdict`: covered | gaps | insufficient

Only bones with two observed endpoints are judged; a bone anchored
by a predicted joint is recorded but never counted as broken.
