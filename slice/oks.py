"""Object Keypoint Similarity — the standard pose-eval metric.

OKS is how COCO scores pose estimates: per visible ground-truth
joint, exp(-d² / 2·(s·k)²) where d is the distance to the prediction,
s is the object's scale (sqrt of its bounding-box area), and k is a
per-joint tolerance constant — small for high-precision joints
(hips), large for variable ones (wrists). Joints absent from the
reference don't count, so an estimate is never penalized for joints
the reference itself can't see.
