"""Audit the priors themselves — are the model tables sane?

Everything downstream trusts `BODY_MODELS`: model selection, height
proportions, predicted limb placement. Those numbers were written
by hand and never checked — a typo'd ratio (say, shin longer than
thigh) would flow through every estimate as "the prior says so"
with no one the wiser.

`audit` runs five structural checks over each model:

- `keyset`      — all models carry the same required keys
- `bounds`      — every ratio is a plausible fraction of height
- `limb_order`  — thigh ≥ shin, upper_arm ≥ forearm (anatomically
                  the upper segment is the longer one)
- `stack`       — head+torso+thigh+shin sums to a coherent share of
                  height (0.7–1.1; neck/hand/foot fill the rest)
- `head_order`  — deformed > child > adult head_ratio (the declared
                  stylization ordering; if it inverts, `select_model`
                  drifts)

Each fired issue names model, check, and the raw values — the
audit reports what the table *says*, not what it "meant".
