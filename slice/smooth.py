"""Temporal smoothing of joint tracks across a frame series.

Per-frame estimates jitter — a wrist jumps a few pixels frame to
frame even when the person is still. `smooth` applies a symmetric
moving average over each joint's track, cutting jitter while
keeping real motion. Missing frames break nothing: a joint absent
from a window's frames just averages what exists, and frames where
the joint is missing stay missing — smoothing never invents a
position. And an observed centre averages only observed neighbours:
predicted guesses in the window must not pull a measured joint
toward a fabricated location.
