"""Knowledge document migration — bring old docs forward safely.

Stored documents age: schema bumps, new blocks (`coverage`,
`prediction`), fields that didn't exist when the doc was written.
`upgrade` normalizes a document to the current schema — but every
gap it fixes is a *disclosed* fix, not silent fabrication:

- missing `id`/`created_at`/`engine` get real defaults and a change
  entry — `created_at` becomes "" rather than a made-up timestamp
- missing `export`/`prediction`/`coverage`/`skeleton.bones` are
  **recomputed** from the doc's own joints (derivable data, not
  guessed data)
- a joint missing `state` is marked `predicted` with basis
  "migrated: state unknown" — claiming `observed` would fabricate
  evidence
- a joint missing `x`/`y` cannot be invented: it is *dropped* and
  recorded as `joint_dropped`
- `schema` is set to the current `SCHEMA` once the doc actually
  satisfies it — never before

`upgrade(doc)` returns {document, changes, valid_before,
valid_after} — the caller sees exactly what was repaired and can
verify the result validates.
