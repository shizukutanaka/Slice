"""Person re-identification — pose-invariant identity cues.

`slice.signature`-style pose vectors answer "same pose?". Re-id asks
the opposite question: "same person, whatever the pose?". The cues that
survive a pose change are proportions — bone-length ratios are fixed
per person (forearm/upper-arm, shin/thigh, shoulder/torso ...), so a
ratio vector is (mostly) invariant to how the limbs happen to be
arranged in the frame.

Honesty contract: every reported number is `state: "estimated"` — a
2D projection makes true bone lengths pose-dependent in reality, so
this is a soft cue for triage, not biometric proof. Features whose
source joints were predicted rather than observed are counted and
disclosed; comparison only uses features present on both sides.
