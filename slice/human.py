"""Person-likeness of a foreground blob — check the assumption.

The estimator's silent assumption is that a large foreground
component *is* a person. A lamp post, a cardboard box, or a dog
all survive the size gates and come out wearing a full skeleton —
wrongly confident `observed` joints on a non-human shape.

`assess(comp)` scores a component mask (rows of 0/1 bytes) on four
person-shape signals, each reported with its measured value:

- `aspect`: height/width ratio — standing people are tall
  (fallen/sitting people break this; it only weakens the score,
  never vetoes)
- `fill`: occupancy inside the bounding box — people are lumpy,
  boxes are dense
- `head_mass`: foreground fraction in the top fifth, in a narrow
  band — heads concentrate mass near the top centre
- `symmetry`: left/right mirrored overlap of the row profile —
  frontal people are roughly bilateral

Each signal maps to [0,1]; `score` is the mean. `person_like`
requires score ≥ `PERSON_LIKE_MIN` **and** every signal above
`SIGNAL_FLOOR` — a rectangle is tall and perfectly symmetric, so
mean alone can't reject it; its zero fill must veto. The verdict
is advisory — a low score means "the blob doesn't look like a
person shape", never "no person present" (poses outside the
signal assumptions lose points, and the caller decides).
