"""Confidence calibration — turn heuristic scores into measured ones.

Every joint carries `confidence` between 0 and 1, but the value is a
hand-set heuristic (0.8 for a widest-row shoulder, 0.55 for a
fallback hip) — *how often is a 0.8 joint actually right?* Nothing
in the document answers that, so downstream consumers can't rank a
0.75 wrist against a 0.75 shoulder honestly.

`reliability_table` answers it empirically: run the estimator over
ground-truth fixture pairs, bin joints by their reported
confidence, and measure the hit rate inside each bin — the standard
reliability diagram from calibration theory. `lookup` then maps an
arbitrary confidence to the empirical accuracy its bin showed, and
`apply` annotates a skeleton with those calibrated values — as a
side record, never overwriting the raw score.

Report-only by design: the raw estimator output stays untouched;
the calibration is disclosed next to it.
