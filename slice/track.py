"""Temporal ID — stable identity for skeletons across a frame sequence.

P3-19: the honest-contract tracker. Today each `analyze` produces an
independent skeleton; `track` threads them together so "the person in
frame 12" is the same `track_id` as in frame 3.

Scope is deliberately narrow — Slice estimates ONE person per image, so
this is a 1-track occupancy problem: does the next frame's skeleton
continue the current track, or was the person lost/re-acquired? Matching
is greedy nearest by pelvis distance (or centroid when pelvis is missing),
with a configurable max jump in torso-length units so a re-appearing
person elsewhere in frame starts a new track instead of teleporting.

Every assignment reports `state:"linked"` (continuity claim backed by a
distance measurement) — a track is a hypothesis, not a fact; the
`gap` field records frames skipped inside a track honestly.
